        "1. What is the difference between regression and classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "Regression is predicting a certain numeric outcome, and classification is predicting a categorical outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a confusion table? What does it help us understand about a model's performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "A confusion table is a cross-tabulation of the predicted values and the actual values for classification. Seeing the predicted values next to the actual values allows us to understand how accurate our model it with its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does the SSE quantify about a particular model?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Sum of Squared Error quantifies how \"good\" the fit of a model is. It is a way to measure how far the predicted values are from the true values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are overfitting and underfitting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting is when the model is too complex and specific to reliably predict or explain a phenomenon of interest. Underfitting is when the model is too simple to actually predict a phenomenon of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why does splitting the data into training and testing sets, and choosing $k$ by evaluating accuracy or SSE on the test set, improve model performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Splitting the data into a training set and a testing set is important because the model will learn from the training data, and then can test on the other half rather than also checking performance on the training set. By choosing k based on the SSE on the test set, you can use a value of k that works best for the dataset to avoid over or under fitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. With classification, we can report a class label as a prediction or a probability distribution over class labels. Please explain the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prediction is predicting the most likely category, and the probability distribution is showing the probability of the case belonging to each category. Prediction is useful because it's fast and simple, only providing you with the most likely category. Though one weakness is that even if the model is not confident of a category prediction it will still have to label it as a category which could produce innaccurate predictions. The probability distribution shows its confidence in each category for a certain case, so you can look at this information and still make a more educated prediction decision if the percentages of confidence are less certain one way. Although a weakness of this strategy is that there is more information to interpret and it is not as quick as regualr prediction.\n",
